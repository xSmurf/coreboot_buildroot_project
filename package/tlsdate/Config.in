	  tlsdate: secure parasitic rdate replacement
	  
	  tlsdate sets the local clock by securely connecting with TLS to remote
	  servers and extracting the remote time out of the secure handshake. Unlike
	  ntpdate, tlsdate uses TCP, for instance connecting to a remote HTTPS or TLS
	  enabled service, and provides some protection against adversaries that try to
	  feed you malicious time information.
