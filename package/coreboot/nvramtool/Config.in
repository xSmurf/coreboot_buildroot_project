      nvramtool is a utility for reading/writing coreboot parameters in NVRAM/CMOS
      and displaying information from the so-called 'coreboot table'.
      The coreboot table resides in low physical memory. It is created at
      boot time by coreboot, and contains various system information such as
      the type of mainboard in use. It specifies locations in the NVRAM/CMOS
      (nonvolatile RAM) where the coreboot parameters are stored.
